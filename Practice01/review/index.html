		There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
		instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
		<mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
		<br><br>
		You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
		<blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
    	time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
    	we seek.</blockquote>
    	not to mention how easy commenting is in html<br>

		<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
		<div>
			<p>A &lt div &gt is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line and take up the full width available.</p>
		</div>
		<span>
			<p>And a &lt span &gt tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
		</span>
