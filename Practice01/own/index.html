        <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, 
            <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
            <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
        </p>
        <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
            <blockquote>
                Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
                time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
                we seek.
            </blockquote>

            A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
            and take up the full width available.
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span>
            And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
        </span>
        </p>
        <p class="big">
